This project is about making a piano with Arduino Mega 2560. The piano will light up the corresponding LEDs that you have pressed. Let's get started!

We will need through-hole 12mm 1cm tall tact switches and their caps. The piano keyboard is arranged such that it is user friendly as you can place all your fingers on the keyboard.

Why use castellated holes in this project?

We can join the keyboard together with the help of castellated holes at the edges of the PCBs. Please solder the castellated holes side by side first before soldering the components on the PCB to make the PCBs straight.

The LEDs on the keyboard are connected such that they will light up when you press the corresponding keys.

We will need to connect all the ground pins of the PCBs together with the Arduino Mega board.

Tips on making castellated holes in PCBs using EasyEDA:

Click on pad icon in PCB Tools. At the Pad Properties, ensure that Multi-Layer is selected. You can change the pad size and pad hole size values.
